# Overview

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) (JavaScript testing framework) and we are assigned to write multiple test suites to ensure the app is work fine.

# Getting started

  1. extract all files.
  2. Open index.html file with your browser and make sure you are connected to the internet to pass all test suites.
